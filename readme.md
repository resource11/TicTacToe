# A Tic-Tac-Toe Game

### Overview

This is my first attempt creating a **Tic Tac Toe**, game.


High-level project goals:

* **Build a web application from scratch**, without a starter codebase
* Use programming skills to **map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe**
* **Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files** in the application
* Build an application **to a spec provided by another party**
* **Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete** (bonus: compete from separate devices)
* **Craft a ``readme.md`` file that explains this app** to the world
* **Communicate with a provided back-end** to store game state.
